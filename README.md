# Movies-ETL
## Purpose:
To establish an automated data pipeline that extracts Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and MovieLens rating data for movies, transforms it appropriately, and loads it into existing tables in a PostgreSQL database per ETL process.
## Resources:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pgAdmin 4
- movies_metadata.csv, wikipedia-movies.json, ratings.csv
  - NOTE: Due to file size, I was unable to upload ratings.csv even in a zipped folder.
